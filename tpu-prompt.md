# Enhanced Hybrid Genome Cell System with Simple TPU Integration

## Objective
Extend the successful MVP to include a simplified TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) component that enables parallel computation and matrix operations, while maintaining the core bio-AI evolution concept. The TPU should provide computational advantages that create selective pressure for cells to evolve more sophisticated neural architectures.

## Core Enhancements

### 1. Simple TPU Component
```python
class SimpleTpu:
    cores: int              # Number of parallel processing cores (1-8)
    memory: int             # TPU memory capacity (affects problem complexity)
    efficiency: float       # Energy efficiency multiplier (0.5-2.0)
    parallel_capacity: int  # Max problems processed simultaneously
```

**TPU Genome (8-bit addition to bio genome)**:
- `tpu_cores` (3-bit, 1-8): Number of processing cores
- `tpu_memory` (3-bit, 1-8): Memory capacity (scales problem complexity)
- `tpu_efficiency` (2-bit, 0-3): Energy efficiency level

### 2. Enhanced Problem Types
**Tier 1 (Single-core)**: Basic addition (current system)
**Tier 2 (Multi-core)**: Matrix multiplication (2x2 matrices)
**Tier 3 (High-memory)**: Pattern recognition (simple 3x3 image classification)
**Tier 4 (Parallel)**: Batch processing (solve multiple problems simultaneously)

**Problem Assignment Logic**:
- Cells receive problems based on their TPU capabilities
- Higher-tier problems offer exponentially better energy rewards
- TPU configuration determines which problems are accessible

### 3. Parallel Processing Mechanics
- **Batch Problems**: Cells with multi-core TPUs can solve multiple problems per tick
- **Energy Scaling**: Better TPU = access to higher-reward problem tiers
- **Computational Load**: Complex problems require minimum TPU specs
- **Efficiency Bonus**: Higher efficiency reduces energy cost of computation

### 4. Enhanced Neural Architecture Evolution
**Expanded AI Genome**:
- Network depth (2-4 layers) determined by TPU memory
- Network width (2-16 neurons per layer) limited by TPU cores
- Activation functions selected based on TPU efficiency rating
- Weight precision (8-bit to 32-bit) affects accuracy vs speed

### 5. Resource Competition & Specialization
**Problem Pool System**:
- Limited high-value problems available each tick
- Cells compete for premium computational tasks
- Specialization pressure: generalists vs specialists
- TPU-enabled cells can dominate certain niches

## Implementation Strategy

### New Components
```python
class TpuCell(HybridCell):
    tpu: SimpleTpu
    neural_architecture: dict    # Depth, width, precision
    problem_history: list        # Track problem-solving specialization
    
def assign_problems(population, problem_pool)
def evaluate_tpu_performance(cell, problem_type)
def evolve_tpu_specs(parent_tpu, mutation_rate)
```

### TPU-Aware Evolution
- **Architectural Constraints**: TPU specs limit possible neural networks
- **Co-evolution**: TPU and neural architecture must evolve together
- **Trade-offs**: More powerful TPUs cost more energy to maintain
- **Specialization**: Cells evolve toward specific problem domains

### Success Metrics
- **Computational Diversity**: Multiple problem-solving strategies emerge
- **TPU Utilization**: Cells efficiently use their computational resources
- **Performance Scaling**: Better TPUs enable better problem-solving
- **Energy Efficiency**: Evolution optimizes compute-per-energy-unit

## Advanced Features to Explore

### 1. TPU Memory Hierarchies
- Local cache for frequently accessed data
- Shared memory pools between related cells
- Memory allocation strategies that affect performance

### 2. Distributed Computing
- Cell clusters that share TPU resources
- Collaborative problem-solving across multiple cells
- Communication costs and benefits

### 3. Dynamic Problem Complexity
- Problem difficulty scales with population capabilities
- Adaptive challenges that maintain selective pressure
- Multi-step problems requiring sustained computation

### 4. TPU Wear and Aging
- Computational components degrade over time
- Maintenance energy costs for TPU upkeep
- Trade-offs between performance and longevity

## Research Questions
1. Do cells evolve TPU architectures optimized for specific problem types?
2. Can computational specialization lead to symbiotic relationships between cells?
3. How does TPU energy cost vs performance create evolutionary trade-offs?
4. Will parallel processing capabilities lead to more complex neural architectures?
5. Can cells evolve to share computational resources efficiently?

## Expected Evolutionary Outcomes
- **Hardware-Software Co-evolution**: TPU specs and neural architectures evolve together
- **Computational Niches**: Different cell lineages specialize in different problem domains
- **Efficiency Optimization**: Natural selection for better compute-per-energy ratios
- **Emergent Complexity**: More sophisticated problem-solving strategies develop
- **Resource Utilization**: Cells learn to maximize their computational investments
